### 4. Write the case study.

Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.

Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.


### 5. Upload your case study to your git repository.

You learned some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it to a repository to share with your instructor and class.
